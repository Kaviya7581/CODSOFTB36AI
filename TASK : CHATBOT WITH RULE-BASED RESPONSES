#prompt: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
#Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
#predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
#techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
#responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
#language processing and conversation flow.
